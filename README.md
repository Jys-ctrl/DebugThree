# DebugThree
Debugging Exercises - Classes/ADTs
Each of the following files has syntax and/or logic errors. In each case, determine and fix the problem. After you correct the errors, save each file using the same filename preceded with the word "Fix". For example, DebugThree1.java will become FixDebugThree1.java.  (Please take note that in Java, filename and class name must always match.)
